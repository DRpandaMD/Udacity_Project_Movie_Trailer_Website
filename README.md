# Udacity_Project_Movie_Trailer_Website

First have the latest version of Python installed on your machine.

I am running python 2.7.10.

To run the code simply run the python script by running "python movie_listing.py".

It will create a bunch of moive objects,

Add them to a list.  

Pass that list to some helper code in fresh_tomatoes.py.

In that helper file it has a ton of extra code that sets up a html page, sets up bootstrap and jquery and some other functions to help run the website.
